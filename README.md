# clarkenciel-site

Personal site of Danny Clarke. I use this as a playground for various UI and server/client-architecture design ideas that I come up with in the shower, but probably wouldn't be, strictly speaking, the best idea in a "business context," but which can lead to interesting places.

I guess it's lightly experimental web art and a portfolio.
